This pair of workshops will introduce the R programming language, popular in the field of biologging.

In the "introductory" session we will explore some of the popular software packages suitable for exploring and plotting acoustic telemetry data, including `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, for the purpose of generating summaries for reports.

The second "advanced" session offers a brief overview of the `glatos` R package for performing detection filtering, various calculations and plotting. The data is then transformed for ingestion into the powerful acoustic telemetry packages `VTrack`.
